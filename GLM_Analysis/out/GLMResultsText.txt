Using model-predicted frequencies and known mutation rates, we find that CpG-creating synonymous mutations are 4 times more costly (selection coefficient appr. 0.001) than non-CpG-creating synonymous mutations (selection coefficient ~0.00027 )).

POINT 2



Indeed, the estimated selection coefficients based on model predictions suggested that synonymous G to A mutations are
2.41
times as costly as non-CpG-forming A to G mutations (
7e-04
vs
3e-04
).

 Note that p-values come from analyseAndFigures-Bacheler.Rmd


POINT 3



In general, mutations that led to a drastic amino acid change were found at lower frequency than mutations that did not ($p < 0.001$).

For example, A to G mutations that result in a drastic amino acid change are roughly
3.26
times more costly than A to G mutations that do not (
0.0017
vs
5e-04
).
We observed similar fold changes for the other possible transitions.


POINT 4


There was also an effect of whether or not a non-synonymous mutation created a 
CpG site ($p < 0.001$ for both A-G and T-C mutations). 
The difference in frequencies suggests that, 
among mutations that do not lead to a drastic amino acid change, 
    A-G mutations that create a CpG site are approximately
1.58
times more costly than those that do not 
8e-04
vs
5e-04


Similarly, 
among mutations that do not lead to a drastic amino acid change, 
            T-C mutations that create a CpG site are approximately 
3.66
times more costly than those that do not
0.0017
vs
5e-04


POINT 5


We estimated that, among non-synonymous mutations that do not involve a drastic amino acid change 
or create a CpG site, 
            C-T mutations are 

6.05
times more costly than A-G mutations 
0.0031
vs
5e-04
, and G-A mutations are 
3.87
times more costly than A-G mutations
0.0018
vs
5e-04
