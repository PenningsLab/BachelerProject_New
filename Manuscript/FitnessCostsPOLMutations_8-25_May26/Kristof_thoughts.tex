# Just some comments

1. codon-based analysis?  condition on the position in the triplet, same results?
Is the cost dependent on the codon position? 
    - 1st 2nd 3rd position: syn or non
    - 1st 2nd 3rd position: frequency
    - syn ~ freq for each position. 

2. nucleotide identity: only for non-syn sites.  using a single ref sequence, maybe we have a bias? since there is always only one transition possible.
