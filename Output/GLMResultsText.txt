MUTRATES FROM ABRAM 2010


POINT 1

Using model-predicted frequencies and known mutation rates, we find that CpG-creating synonymous mutations are 2 times more costly (selection coefficient appr. 4e-03) than non-CpG-creating synonymous mutations (selection coefficient ~2e-03 )).

More detail 
A-G mutations
1.94
3.9e-03
2.01e-03

C-T mutations
1.89
3.7e-03
1.98e-03


POINT 2



Indeed, the estimated selection coefficients based on model predictions suggested that synonymous G to A mutations are
2.4
times as costly as non-CpG-forming A to G mutations (
4.8e-03
vs
2e-03
).


Indeed, the estimated selection coefficients based on model predictions suggested that synonymous C to T mutations are
1.96
times as costly as non-CpG-forming A to G mutations (
3.9e-03
vs
2e-03
).

 Note that p-values come from analyseAndFigures-Bacheler.Rmd


POINT 3



In general, mutations that led to a drastic amino acid change were found at lower frequency than mutations that did not ($p < 0.001$).

For example, A to G mutations that result in a drastic amino acid change are roughly
2
times more costly than A to G mutations that do not (
5.7e-03
vs
2.8e-03
).
We observed similar fold changes for the other possible transitions.


POINT 4


There was also an effect of whether or not a non-synonymous mutation created a 
    CpG site ($p < 0.001$ for both A-G and T-C mutations). 
    The difference in frequencies suggests that, 
    among mutations that do not lead to a drastic amino acid change, 
    A-G mutations that create a CpG site are approximately
1.36
times more costly than those that do not 
3.9e-03
vs
2.8e-03


Similarly, 
            among mutations that do not lead to a drastic amino acid change, 
            T-C mutations that create a CpG site are approximately 
0.95
times more costly than those that do not
3.9e-03
vs
4.1e-03


POINT 5


We estimated that, among non-synonymous mutations that do not involve a drastic amino acid change 
            or create a CpG site, 
            C-T mutations are 

5.51
times more costly than A-G mutations 
0.0157
vs
2.8e-03
, and G-A mutations are 
7.39
times more costly than A-G mutations
0.021
vs
2.8e-03
