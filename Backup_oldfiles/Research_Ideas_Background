#Listing of the different conceptual steps to take. 

# rationale
detect synyonm at low or high frequence
detect nonsym at high frequency


# to keep in mind 
-  Graur et al: any change at position 1 and 2 of the codon is always (95% and 100%) nonsynonymous. 
-> so it must be always red red blue/red

# datasets
1. Bacheler dataset -> see script of the analysis
2. Prep dataset: to check for similar patterns 






#Ideas

1. for each site,  calculate substitution frequencies and impact on AA (syn,nonsyn,stop)
  - rank according to frequency
  - double check stop codons (double mutant problem -> check also impact on AA and frequencies
  - positional ranking-> detect regions with low substitutions
  


Protease: minimal conserved AA across subtypes (Svicher): what about the rest?
AA sequences: distance distribution in absolute numbers (use popart)

P(ts) > P(tv): ok
P(nonsyn|tv) > P(nonsyn|ts) but how much (control for tv 2nt en ts 1nt

If you have a substitution matrix: actg (actg)-1 , then you already have some biases 
To what extent does a position deviate from the matrix (which is the 'average')?
