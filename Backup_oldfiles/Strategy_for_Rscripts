mv createFrequencies-bacheler.R backupfiles/
-> the initial file to calculate frequencies of transitions (and as well of transversions and transitions+transversion)

mv RFrequenciesWithinPlotRanked.Rmd backupfiles/
-> script written by Pleuni with efficient methodology to calculate transitions, to plot syn/nonsyn according to ranked frequency, deal with stop codons and plot the sliding window mean within the protein.

mv createFrequencies-bacheler_V2.R backupfiles/
-> only for ts
-> : contains the updated methodologies to calculate mutations frequencies: version 2 v2 removes patients of, given a specific, which days0sequences do not match the consensus nucleotide, and version v3, given a specific codon, do not match the consensus nucleotide. 


analyseAndFigures.Rmd 
-> method 1 by pleuni (old code to assign syn/nonsyn), method 2 by pleuni (new code to assign syn/nonsym), method 3 (ts+tv, tv and assign syn/nonsyn) 
—> analysing output from the ts v1, ts v2 and ts v3 frequencies and integrating the code from RFrequenciesWithinPlotRanked.Rmd
